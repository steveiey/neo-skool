data can be grouped into catagories called types

String/str "sus"
list ["sus"]
boolean true or false
integer/int 1, 4314324322345425432, 3
float/ floating point number 1.2, -4314.2, 1.0

can attribute catagories to values
```python
age = 16
age_float = 16.0
e = "food"
diff types
```

## converting types

special functions in python that convert one type to another
```python
intro = "my name is"
age = 16

```
